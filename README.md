<h1>动画库</h1>
1.Snap.SVG
SnapSVG is another popular JavaScript library for SVG animation developed by Raphael developer, Dmitry Baranovskiy, 
along with the Adobe Web Platform Team from the ground up. Unlike Raphael though, SnapSVG is meant for only the latest browsers. 
That allows the library to be significantly smaller than Raphael and to support SVG features like clipping and masking.
